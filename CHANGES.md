# v3.0.0 2015/6/16

Puree v3 is not compatible with v2, which uses [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) for the fundamental JSON framework,
 instead of [org.json.JSONObject](http://developer.android.com/reference/org/json/package-summary.html) used before v3.

`Gson` has `JsonObject` class which is functionally compatible with `org.json.JSONObject` so migration is really easy.

Here is the diff between v2 and v3 for the SamplingFilter example:

```diff
     @Override
-    public JSONObject apply(JSONObject jsonLog) throws JSONException {
+    public JsonObject apply(JsonObject jsonLog) {
         return (samplingRate < Math.random() ? null : jsonLog);
     }
 }
```
